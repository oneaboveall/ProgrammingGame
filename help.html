  <p>Some things to know...
  <ul>
    <li>Click on buttons to move around and make descisions!</li>
    <li>You cannot start your story until you pick a name...Everyone needs a name.</li>
    <li>You need a class too, otherwise you'll just be an ordinary person...</li>
    <li>Some events are time sensitive, so pay attention!</li>
    <li>There are a total of 12 places where you can die. Can you find them all?</li>
    <li>Hopefully you have some sense of spatial awareness, the moves are made in absolute directions, and a few relative ones.</li>
    <li>That pesky map, compass or cake might be around here somewhere...or they might not be around at all.</li>
    <li>There can be empty rooms or dead ends. What fun is a dungeon thats linear?</li>
    <li>Orks provide a chance to gain more experience (Attack Value), so don't pass up a chance to kill them!</li>
    <li>While Orks don't kill you, sometimes it takes a few attacks to kill them.</li>
    <li>When you've found everything you might be entered in a chance to win a fantastic, one-of-a-kind prize! No purchase nessecary, details on reverse side of this page.</li>
    <li>Many brave adventurers have come before you...how many will come after you?</li>
